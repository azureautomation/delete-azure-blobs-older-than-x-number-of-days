Delete Azure blobs older than X number of days
==============================================

            

This script deletes Azure blobs that are older than X days.


Provide the Azure Storage Account name, access key and container name as input.


A log file is created tracking the details of blobs that are deleted. Including the count of deleted blobs.


You can create an Azure Automation Runbook from this script and schedule it to run every day. So, you will not be billed for the unwanted data. This is a cost optimization strategy. 


 


 

 

 


        
    
TechNet gallery is retiring! This script was migrated from TechNet script center to GitHub by Microsoft Azure Automation product group. All the Script Center fields like Rating, RatingCount and DownloadCount have been carried over to Github as-is for the migrated scripts only. Note : The Script Center fields will not be applicable for the new repositories created in Github & hence those fields will not show up for new Github repositories.
